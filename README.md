# General info

🎃👻 I've brewed up an eerie Arduino Uno project with a minuscule ghost doing the "spin of the afterlife" on a 3.3V motor. It's so spook-tacular, even Frankenstein would give it a thumbs-up! Dive into the code cauldron if you dare 💻🕸️🧙‍♂️

## Code

- LED and Motor Controlled via Object-Oriented Programming
- You can easily add LEDs and a motor to the main.cpp file.
- Function: startAndTurnOffAfter(5, 600, 2000);
  - Number of spins
  - Duration of each spin
  - Delay between spins

## Hardware

- Arduino UNO
- 3 V Motors are controlled with an IRFZ34N MOSFET
- PIR Sensor for starting the Action
- LED and Resistors
